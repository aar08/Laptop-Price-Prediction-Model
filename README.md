Laptop price prediction using Machine Learning and Streamlit

# 💻 Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the **price of a laptop** based on its specifications using **Machine Learning**.
A **Linear Regression model** is trained on a laptop dataset, and a **Streamlit-based frontend** is used to take user input and display the predicted price in real time.

The project demonstrates the complete **ML workflow**:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training
* Model serialization
* Frontend integration
* GitHub deployment
